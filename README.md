# Spring Boot Rest Example App!

Small example app using some cool features.

## Includes

0. Gradle!
1. Embedded Jetty Server (fat jar, super easy to deploy)
2. Spring Actuator for health checks
3. Hot reloading
4. H2 in memory for the sake of testing
  * Postgres dependency can be swapped in whenever
5. Swagger autogenerated API docs!!


## What does the app do though?

Not much really! It has 2 JPA entities

* Account
  * GameRecord

There is a single controller that provides some RESTful APIs for managing the
game records. (Not one for accounts, so...)

More importantly, we have Swagger Docs, you can find them here:
[localhost swagger page!](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

They are pretty dope, and since the config is setup already
the only thing that has to be done is add an annotation above each
controller mapping.

## Tell me how to run it already!

So it's setup to be run in intellij, but you can happily (and sometimes more happily
than when in intellij) do everything via the command line.

* `cd project/dir`
* `./gradlew build`   -- This downloads the gradle executable so we all have the same version
* `./gradlew tasks`   -- Just lists the possible tasks
* `./gradlew bootRun` -- It's running, go checkout local host.
